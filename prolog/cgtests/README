Subject: Test Cases

In the near future I will be sending a number of messages
of the form SUBJECT: CG TESTi, <kind>,
where kind is graphs, actors, contexts, etc.
Each of these will contain a file that is used in
regression testing CONSTRUCT; that is,
whenever we varified that recent additions had not
made any unexpected changes, we read in each of
these linear form files, wrote them back out, 
and compared the results to verify that the
basic capabilities had not been altered by the additions.

It you are looking for example graphs, these will
include many of the graphs in John Sowa's book plus others.

Cheers, John.
