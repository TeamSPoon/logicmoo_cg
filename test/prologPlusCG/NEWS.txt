Release notes for Prolog+CG

Release 2.0.11
==============

- This release is a bugfix release, fixing five bugs:

  - concOfCG(C,G) had an issue whereby if C was a free variable, the
    whole G would be unified with it, not the individual concepts of
    G.  This has been fixed.

  - The following used to fail: eq(G, C-dummy->[MyConceptType]), at
    least when C was bound and G was free.  An exception would be
    thrown, terminating the interpreter, and leaving the program
    "hanging".  This has been fixed.

  - Sometimes, a cut would result in the same "hanging" behaviour, due
    to an exception being thrown.  This has been fixed.

  - dif/2 used to have an issue whereby too much would be popped off
    the unification stack, thereby causing an exception and the same
    "hanging" behavior.

  - On Win32, when deploying an applet, the directory from which
    Prolog+CG attempted to get PPCGApplet.jar was not the right one.
    This has been fixed.

- In addition, the rudiments of a test suite were added, including a
  command-line version of Prolog+CG.  See the ChangeLog for how to use
  the command-line version.  Hopefully this test suite will be
  developed into a full regression test suite some day.



Release 2.0.10
==============

- This release sees a major restructuring of the code and the
  directory structures.

- The biggest change from a user-perspective is that the classpath has
  changed: It is no longer "." but "classes".

- The default size when the program starts is now 800x600, and the
  main frame is maximized upon startup.

- The debugger inside Prolog+CG now actually works.



Release 2.0.9
=============

- Bugfix: concat/3 had a bug whereby the second argument would be
  returned if the first argument was a free variable.  Obviously, the
  first part of the string, not the second, ought to be returned,
  which it is now.

- The manual has been completely redone in (PDF)LaTeX, with HTML being
  generated by latex2html.  This means that there is now a
  "manual.pdf" in the root of the distribution.

- The system of saving a compiled program to .obj files has been
  removed; now the program is always compiled rather than loaded from
  an .obj file.  This was so as to save the hassle of fixing some
  annoying bugs.  It simply was not an advantage any more, given
  today's fast computers and the advancement of the speed of the JVM.


Release 2.0.8 (April 6, 2005)
=============================

One bug was fixed:

- Some built-in predicates, such as "show", "close", "maxComSubTypes",
  and "addInstance", had become unavailable.  They are now available
  again.

- Added two new built-in predicates and updated the manual
  accordingly: maxComSubTypes(Type1, Type2, ListOfTypes) and
  minComSuperTypes(Type1, Type2, ListOfTypes).  If the type hierarchy
  is not a strict lattice, these can be useful.  See the manual for
  more information on how they are defined.


Release 2.0.7 (April 6, 2005)
=============================

One set of bugs were fixed:

- Fixed bugs in nl and clearConsole so that they do not cause
  premature stops in processing (i.e., an exception being thrown).

Two feature-additions were made:

- A new concat/3 operator was added.  It takes two or three strings.

- It is now possible to have 0 boxes in a PPCG applet.  This is useful
  if you don't need any other input than something from buttons.


Release 2.0.6 (February 3, 2005)
================================

This release sees a number of additions and changes:

- PrologPlusCG can now be run as a web-based applet.  See the manual
  for more information.

- write/1 no longer emits a newline.  Note that this makes your
  programs not backwards compatible if they use write.

- There are three new built-in predicates: nl/0 (which emits a
  newline), writenl/1 (which writes its argument and emits a newline),
  and clearConsole/0 (which clears the console area).

- write and writenl now treat string parameters specially, also when
  encapsulated in variables (but not in terms, CGs, concepts, or any
  other type).  In particular, the beginning and ending "double
  quotes" are removed before printing.  This should make it easier to
  communicate with the user, both in applets and in the usual
  applications.


Enjoy!

Release 2.0.5 (October 16, 2004)
================================

This release has a major bugfix and a feature addition.


Feature-addition
----------------

The feature-addition is that concOfCG now performs
variable-substition, just like branchOfCG.  This means that you can do
things like:

  concOfCG([Proposition = P], _CG)

and expect P to be set.

This was done to solve the problem that when you do things like

  branchOfCG([Proposition = P], _CG)

(which is valid, even if the first argument is not a branch), and _CG
has a branch that says:

[Propositon = ...]-Relation->[Proposition = ...]

then you only get one of the propositions.

I do not believe that the correct way would be to return both
propositions, since branchOfCG is meant to work on branches, not
concepts.  The addition of this feature for concOfCG solves the
problem.


Bugfix
------

It used to be that built-ins such as branchOfCG would not return all
solutions under certain circumstances.  This has been fixed.

One way to trigger this was to attempt a match with the built-in
against something that did not match (e.g., a CG that did not have
such and such a branch).  After that, no more matches could be
generated with the same goal.

This would also sometimes cause the built-ins not to return more than
one result.

This program would trigger it:

---------------- program begins --------------
// Type-hierarchy
Universal > Physical.
Physical > Process, Object.
Process > Act.
Act > Persuade, Speak, Eat.
Object > Animal.

// Catalog of instances
Animal = Wolf, Lamb.

// Graphs

// The wolf persuades the lamb.
graph(gr1, [Animal: Wolf]<-agnt-[Persuade]-rcpt->[Animal: Lamb]).

// The lamb speaks to the wolf.
graph(gr2, [Animal: Lamb]<-agnt-[Speak]-rcpt->[Animal: Wolf]).

// The wolf eats the lamb.
graph(gr3, [Animal: Wolf]<-agnt-[Eat]-ptnt->[Animal: Lamb]).


// Wolf does something in which graph?
// ERROR: gr3 does not appear.
wolf(I) :- 
   graph(I, G),
   branchOfCG([Animal : Wolf]<-agnt-[X], G).

---------------- program ends --------------

A few minor changes have been made in addition to this.  See the
ChangeLog for details.


Enjoy!

Release 2.0.4 (September 21, 2004)
==================================

This release has minor bugfixes:

- variables that start with an underscore are now treated as such.

- You can no longer have non-atoms in a type hierarchy rule or
  catalog-of-instances rule (e.g., before, you could have a variable,
  which was not good!)

- PPCG now ignores carriage returns, meaning that you should no longer
  get problems with "error in line 1" just because you pressed return.
  This used to be a problem on Windows.

- The caret in the console area is no longer repositioned every time
  you release the mouse.  This should make it easier to select stuff
  with the mouse and copy it.  This means that you should no longer
  need to hold down the mouse button while pressing "Ctrl-C" to copy.



Release 2.0.3 (July 16, 2004)
=============================

This release has one minor feature-enhancement:

You can now press Ctrl-C in the console area and put whatever is
selected on the clipboard.  Then you can paste it again with Ctrl-V.
This is useful, e.g., when you want to run the same query over and
over again.

You must select the piece of text you wish to copy, then, while
holding down the mouse button, press Ctrl-C, then release the mouse
button.  You can then press Ctrl-V to paste what is on the clipboard.

Many thanks to Aldo de Moor for suggesting this change.

Enjoy!

Release 2.0.2 (July 8, 2004)
============================

This is a bugfix release related to the manual.  A number of missing
files were added, and a number of broken links corrected.

In addition, some bugs were fixed in the HTMLFrame showing the manual.
In particular:

1) moving the mouse over a link no longer instantly attempts to follow
   the link.

2) If for some reason an external URL cannot be loaded, this is now
   handled gracefully.

See ChangeLog.txt for details.

Enjoy!

Release 2.0.1 (July 6, 2004)
============================

This is the initial release of the Open Source version of Prolog+CG.
Prof. Kabbaj, the original author of Prolog+CG, has graciously
authorized me to release it as Open Source under the LGPL.

It is based on version 2.0 from August 2000, available from:

http://www.insea.ac.ma/CGTools/PROLOG+CG.htm

I, Ulrik Petersen, am the current maintainer.  All bugreports and
comments should go to me, not Prof. Kabbaj.  Note that I cannot offer
support for Prolog+CG.  Instead, check out the resources at the
website:

http://prologpluscg.sourceforge.net/docs.html

Note also that this is a legacy version, and that it is in
*maintenance mode*, not development mode.  Prof. Kabbaj is working on
a new, better replacement, to be included in the Amine platform:

http://amine-platform.sourceforge.net/

Please note: This software is in maintenance mode.  This means that
bugs will be fixed as time allows and as they are reported to the
maintainer.  However, evelopment of new features takes place in the
new development branch for the Amine platform.


Changes over version 2.0:

- Made it compile under Java 1.4.

- Pretty-printed all Java sources.

- Fixed bug: It used to be that you always had to select "New" after
  starting the program in order not to incur an error when compiling
  the program you just typed in.  Now you don't need to.

- Fixed an off-by-one error in the line-numbering when compiling:
  Error messages now report the correct line number, and not the
  correct number minus 1.

- Fixed bug: Manual can now be shown from within the program, also on
  Unix platforms.

- Fixed bug: Lower part of the split pane would sometimes not switch
  to query/console mode after a compile, when one clicked the mouse
  inside the lower part.  It always does now.

  At the same time, the lower part is no longer switched when clicking
  the upper part.

  At the same time, the splitter of the split pane is set to the
  middle when one switches from console to compilation output.  It
  also repositions to 3/4 of the size when one switches from
  compilation output to console.  This was because Java 1.4 resized
  the panes such that the program text area had 0 height.

- Removed "Windows | Clear text area", since it was buggy.

- Added a "Go to line" menu-item to the "Edit" menu.  This is handy
  when debugging, since you can jump to the line where the compiler
  had trouble.

- Added a new Samples directory, called "AAU".

- Changed the string "PROLOG+CG" to "PROLOG+CG 2.0" to differentiate
  it from the new version in Amine.

- Updated the "About" box.

- Converted all .gif files to .png due to patent restrictions.

- Updated manual slightly


You need Java 1.4 to run it.

Enjoy!
