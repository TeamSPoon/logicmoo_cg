Amine is a Java Open Source Platform, suited for Ontology-based applications, Knowledge-Based Applications,
Conceptual Graph based applications, intelligent systems, and Multi-Agents Systems.

Amine Java source code has been compiled with JDK 1.8

Amine platform is hosted by sourceforge.net: 
- Amine Project: //sourceforge.net/projects/amine-platform/
- Amine Web Site: //amine-platform.sourceforge.net/
- Amine Release: files Amine8_5.zip and Amine8WebSite.zip can be downloaded from 
                                //sourceforge.net/projects/amine-platform/
		  

Download and decompress Amine8_5.zip. It contains the Java source code in "src" directory, 
the APIs documentation in "docAPIs" directory, the compiled code in "classes" directory and 
the batch-file "runAmine.bat" that we use to activate AmineSuiteGUI. AmineSuiteGUI provides 
an access to all the GUIs, the samples, and the tests available currently in the platform 
(except for the MAS layer). 
Amine8_5.zip contains also an executable jar file: "aminePlatform8_5.jar".
Also, Amine8_5.zip contains directory "lib" for the used libraries.


To run Amine, user can use directly (with a simple double click on) the executable jar file: aminePlatform8_5.jar

Another possibility is to use Java instruction "java ..." : in this case, each user should set his/her 
own batch-file depending on the path of the JDK used. On Windows, you can modify "runAmine.bat" to take 
into account your own JDK path. A similar file can be created for operating systems other than Windows. 


Amine8_5.zip contains also External package(s) used by Amine Platform : jdom-b8.jar which 
corresponds to JDOM version 1.0 Beta 7, (c) Jason Hunter and Brett McLaughlin
JDOM license: BSD/Apache style, see //www.jdom.org/ for more detail. 
It contains also packages for Jade platform and for OWL.


Download and decompress Amine8WebSite.zip. It contains the Amine Web Site which provides valuable
documentation on Amine platform and its components.

Enjoy
